Barwick CJ: High Court is the guardian of the Constitution: dismissed argument that the terms of s 57 were directory rather than mandatory; if the joint sitting were not authorized by law (i.e. pursuant to the constitutional powers of the Governor General), a law passed by that joint sitting would be invalid; Senate no mere ‘house of review’, and as evident from the provisions of section 53-55, was essentially the equal of the House of Representatives. Therefore requires opportunity to properly consider a bill; would have to be demonstrated that the Senate was merely prevaricating before a delay could be considered 'failing to pass' the bill; the conduct of the Senate has to be considered on a case-by-case basis; referring a bill to a select committee might be considered 'failing to pass' in certain circumstances; on these facts, adjourning consideration until the next day of sitting (albeit after Christmas) was not prevarication and was not there for a failure to pass.",

The Court specified that the issue at hand was whether the Victorian Parliament could confer this power on the Victorian Court. It held that Chapter III allows courts power incidental to the exercise of judicial power. This explains why there are examples in the Federal Court and family law and established exceptions relating to privacy and trade secrets that allow courts to restrict publication of evidence and conduct proceedings in private regardless of section 17 of the Federal Court act that requires an open court in principle. The consequences are that first, there is no absolute limit on the legislative power from Chapter III; second, a law such as this is valid and does not deny an essential characteristic of a court exercising federal jurisdiction; and third, because of this it is not an attack on institutional integrity of the court as independent and impartial",
